  These LEDs are very bright and use more current than a microcontroller
  can supply on it's own through a pin.  2N2222 NPN transistor is used
  here as a switch.
 
  Excusing the poor ASCII art, the schematic looks something like this:                                    
                                    
                                       Vin = 5V

  Design Considerations:
 
  Power Supply (Vin):
  It is possible, and frequently desireable, to use a different power
  source than the microcontroller. The LED description lists the forward
  current as 700mA.  This could stress the power supply on the microcontroller.
  In this example I used a separate 5V source.
  
  Current Limiting Resistors (R1 and R2):
  The current through the LED should be limited to 700mA max with a resistor
  (R2 above).  Using the circuit above I measured 140mA, although I
  was expecting more.  Note that this resistor should be rated for the
  the power it will disipate.  In the case of 140mA, a 600mW resistor is
  adequate. The 2N2222 is rated at 625mW.
   
  Resistor R1 limits current from the microcontroller into the base of the
  transistor.
   
  Pin:
  Any digital pin can be used.  
 
  Note that the blink code that follows is the same as that in the standard
  "Hello World" blink an LED except perhaps for the pin.

  delay(1500);                   // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LEDpin, LOW);     // turn off high intensity LED
  delay(500);                   // wait for a second
